###### TYPING TRAINER
###### Usage
To start the game just insert a text into the input field.
Once a paragraph is completed, results (the last 3 paragraphs) will be displayed in the table in the upper left corner.

The faster you type, the faster the submarine uses special engines that make the universe move around it instead.
